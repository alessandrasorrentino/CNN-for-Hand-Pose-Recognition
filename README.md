# CNN-for-Hand-Pose-Recognition
Hand pose recognition is an important issue in the context of sign language recognition and human-robot interac- tion(HRI). The aim of our work is to contribute to this challenge, developing a Convolutional Neural Network able to recognize different hand poses. Training and testing have been performed using NUS hand pose dataset. This work also want to solve the problem of using a small dataset. For a neural network the size of the dataset is very important, since it highly affects the performance, so we increased the amount of samples using some data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, in the experiments, we adjust some technical parameters, until our network classified 4 hand pose classes with 92% accuracy and 94% precision. Our results demonstrate that having a large dataset is crucial for classification and recognition tasks.
